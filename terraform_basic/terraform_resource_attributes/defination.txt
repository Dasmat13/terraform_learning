time_static (Resource)
Manages a static time resource, which keeps a locally sourced UTC timestamp stored in the Terraform state. This prevents perpetual differences caused by using the timestamp() function.


resource "time_static" "example" {}

output "current_time" {
  value = time_static.example.rfc3339
}
